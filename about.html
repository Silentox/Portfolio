        <h6>Hey!
            I started playing with computers at the age of 12, it took a lot of trial and error but an year later i had built my very first gaming PC, 
            i was an active member of overclock.net at the time and they as a community taught me a lot of what i know about the hardware aspect of computers.

        </h6>
        
        <h6>
            I was originally going to do computer engineering and my dream was to work at AMD or Intel making designing CPUs, 
            but life happened and a lot of unfortunate circumstances happened with my family.
        </h6>

        <h6>
            Fast forward 6 years, and i got into University Of Toronto for their rigorous Full stack web dev bootcamp where i took my love for computers and programming to a profressional level. 
z        </h6>
        <h6>
            In my free time, i love hiking and the outdoors, playing chess, looking at dog memes, sipping on craft beer and being spontaneous.
